# Hi there 👋 I'm Yuchen WANG!

🎓 I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Tohoku University and serving as a JSPS DC2 research fellow. I specialize in deep learning, imitation learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, and embodied intelligence.

🔬 My research interests include:
- Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
- Time Series Analysis, LSTM and Transformer
- Embodied Intelligence
- Bio-inspired Robotics
- Control Systems and Machine Learning

💻 I work mainly with:
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- MuJoCo, OpenAI Gymnasium
- Data Analysis & Simulation Tools

🚀 Selected Projects:
